An AI that predicts whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.

## Summary


Given information about a user - how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. - predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not using a nearest-neighbor classifier. 

To train the classifier, we use some data from a shopping website from about 12,000 users sessions. To determine the accuracy of our model, we measure two values: sensitivity (also known as the “true positive rate”) and specificity (also known as the “true negative rate”).
